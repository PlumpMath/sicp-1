I started watching the video lectures of the MIT course "Structure and Interpretation" : link -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY&playnext=1&list=PL178B04CCA16FFAFE

This repository is the collections of all exercises and algorithm implementations in Haskell, which i wrote during this course.
